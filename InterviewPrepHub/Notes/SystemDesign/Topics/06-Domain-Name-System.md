## 1. What is DNS?

DNS (Domain Name System) translates **human-readable domain names** (like `www.google.com`) into **IP addresses** (like `142.250.80.4`) that computers use to communicate.

```
You type: www.google.com
DNS returns: 142.250.80.4
Your browser: connects to 142.250.80.4
```

Without DNS, you'd have to memorize IP addresses for every website. DNS is one of the most critical pieces of internet infrastructure.

## 2. How DNS Resolution Works

When you type a URL into your browser, here's what happens:

```
Step-by-step DNS resolution for "www.example.com"

  ┌──────────────┐
  │   Browser    │ 1. Check browser cache
  │              │    → Found? Use it. Done.
  └──────┬───────┘    → Not found? Ask the OS.
         │
  ┌──────▼───────┐
  │   OS Cache   │ 2. Check OS cache (/etc/hosts, local cache)
  │              │    → Found? Use it. Done.
  └──────┬───────┘    → Not found? Ask the resolver.
         │
  ┌──────▼───────┐
  │  Recursive   │ 3. ISP's DNS resolver (or 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)
  │  Resolver    │    Checks its cache.
  │  (ISP/Public)│    → Found? Use it. Done.
  └──────┬───────┘    → Not found? Start the lookup chain.
         │
  ┌──────▼───────┐
  │  Root DNS    │ 4. "I don't know www.example.com, but 
  │  Server      │     .com is handled by these servers..."
  │  (13 global) │     → Returns TLD server addresses
  └──────┬───────┘
         │
  ┌──────▼───────┐
  │  TLD DNS     │ 5. ".com TLD server: example.com is handled
  │  Server      │     by these nameservers..."
  │  (.com)      │     → Returns authoritative NS addresses
  └──────┬───────┘
         │
  ┌──────▼───────┐
  │ Authoritative│ 6. "www.example.com = 93.184.216.34"
  │  DNS Server  │     → Returns the actual IP address
  │ (example.com)│
  └──────────────┘

Total round trips: Up to 4 (but usually 1-2 thanks to caching)
Typical time: 20-120ms (uncached), <1ms (cached)
```

## 3. DNS Hierarchy

DNS is organized as a **hierarchical tree:**

```
                    . (Root)
                   /    |    \
               .com   .org   .io    ← Top-Level Domains (TLD)
              / |  \
         google example amazon      ← Second-Level Domains
          / \      |
       www  mail   www              ← Subdomains (Hostnames)
```

### The Root Zone

- **13 root server clusters** worldwide (named A through M)
- Each "server" is actually a cluster of many machines using anycast
- Maintained by organizations like ICANN, IANA, VeriSign, NASA, etc.
- They don't know every domain — they only know who handles each TLD

### TLD Servers

- Managed by registries (e.g., VeriSign for `.com`, Public Interest Registry for `.org`)
- They know which authoritative nameservers handle each second-level domain

### Authoritative Nameservers

- The final authority for a domain
- Configured by the domain owner (or their DNS provider)
- These servers know the actual IP addresses for hostnames

## 4. DNS Record Types

| Record Type | Purpose | Example |
|------------|---------|---------|
| **A** | Maps a hostname to an **IPv4** address | `www.example.com → 93.184.216.34` |
| **AAAA** | Maps a hostname to an **IPv6** address | `www.example.com → 2606:2800:220:1:248:...` |
| **CNAME** | Creates an **alias** (one hostname points to another) | `blog.example.com → example.wordpress.com` |
| **NS** | Specifies the **authoritative nameservers** for a domain | `example.com NS ns1.dnsimple.com` |
| **MX** | Specifies the **mail servers** for a domain | `example.com MX mail.example.com (priority 10)` |
| **TXT** | Stores **arbitrary text** (often used for verification, SPF, DKIM) | `example.com TXT "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com"` |
| **SRV** | Specifies a **host and port** for a service | `_sip._tcp.example.com SRV 10 60 5060 server.example.com` |
| **SOA** | **Start of Authority** — metadata about the zone (serial number, refresh rate) | Admin info, refresh intervals |
| **PTR** | **Reverse DNS** — maps an IP address back to a hostname | `34.216.184.93 → www.example.com` |

### CNAME vs A Record

```
A Record:     www.example.com → 93.184.216.34
              Directly maps to an IP address.
              Fastest lookup.

CNAME Record: blog.example.com → myblog.wordpress.com
              Points to another domain name.
              Requires an additional lookup to resolve the final IP.
              Cannot be used at the zone apex (example.com itself).

ALIAS Record: example.com → myapp.herokuapp.com
              (vendor-specific, not standard DNS)
              Like CNAME but works at the zone apex.
              Used by Route 53, CloudFlare, etc.
```

## 5. DNS Caching and TTL

### What is TTL?

**TTL (Time to Live)** tells the resolver how long to cache a DNS record before asking again.

```
example.com  A  93.184.216.34  TTL: 300 seconds (5 minutes)

Minute 0: Resolver queries authoritative server → gets IP, caches it
Minute 1: Resolver gets another query → serves from cache
Minute 4: Still cached
Minute 5: Cache expires → must query authoritative server again
```

### TTL Trade-offs

| TTL Length | Pros | Cons |
|-----------|------|------|
| **Short (60-300s)** | Changes propagate quickly; can failover faster | More DNS queries; slightly higher latency |
| **Long (3600-86400s)** | Fewer DNS queries; lower latency | Changes take hours to propagate; slow failover |

### Where DNS is Cached

```
Layer 1: Browser cache (~1-30 minutes, browser-dependent)
Layer 2: OS cache (respects TTL, flushed on restart)
Layer 3: Router/ISP resolver cache (respects TTL)
Layer 4: Recursive resolver cache (respects TTL)

To view your OS DNS cache (macOS):
  sudo dscacheutil -flushcache

To see browser DNS cache (Chrome):
  chrome://net-internals/#dns
```

## 6. DNS-Based Traffic Management

Modern DNS services do much more than simple name-to-IP mapping:

### Weighted Round Robin

Distribute traffic across servers with configurable weights.

```
example.com  A  1.2.3.4  (weight: 70)
example.com  A  5.6.7.8  (weight: 30)

70% of DNS queries return 1.2.3.4
30% of DNS queries return 5.6.7.8

Use cases:
- Gradual migration between old and new servers
- A/B testing
- Canary deployments
- Balancing between different-capacity clusters
```

### Latency-Based Routing

Route users to the **closest (lowest latency)** server.

```
User in New York → DNS returns: us-east server IP
User in London   → DNS returns: eu-west server IP
User in Tokyo    → DNS returns: ap-northeast server IP

How: DNS provider measures latency from resolver networks
     to each endpoint and returns the fastest.
```

### Geolocation-Based Routing

Route users based on their **geographic location.**

```
User in EU → DNS returns: EU server IP (data stays in EU → GDPR)
User in US → DNS returns: US server IP
User in CN → DNS returns: CN server IP

Determined by the IP address of the DNS resolver.
```

### Health-Check-Based Failover

DNS provider monitors server health and removes unhealthy servers from responses.

```
Normal: example.com → [1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8] (both healthy)
Server 1 fails: example.com → [5.6.7.8] (only healthy server)
Server 1 recovers: example.com → [1.2.3.4, 5.6.7.8] (back to both)
```

## 7. DNS in System Design

### Typical Architecture Role

```
User types URL
    │
    ▼
DNS (Route 53 / CloudFlare)
    │ Returns: CDN IP or Load Balancer IP
    │
    ├──→ CDN (for static content: images, CSS, JS)
    │
    └──→ Load Balancer IP (for dynamic content)
            │
            ├──→ App Server 1
            ├──→ App Server 2
            └──→ App Server 3
```

### DNS Failover Architecture

```
Primary Region (US-East)     Secondary Region (US-West)
┌─────────────────┐          ┌─────────────────┐
│ Load Balancer   │          │ Load Balancer   │
│ IP: 1.2.3.4    │          │ IP: 5.6.7.8    │
│ ┌───┐ ┌───┐    │          │ ┌───┐ ┌───┐    │
│ │App│ │App│    │          │ │App│ │App│    │
│ └───┘ └───┘    │          │ └───┘ └───┘    │
└─────────────────┘          └─────────────────┘

DNS Health Check:
  ✅ Primary healthy → DNS returns 1.2.3.4
  ❌ Primary down    → DNS returns 5.6.7.8 (failover)
```

## 8. Disadvantages of DNS

| Disadvantage | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Slight delay** | DNS lookup adds latency to the first request (mitigated by caching) |
| **Caching causes staleness** | After a DNS change, cached records serve the old IP until TTL expires |
| **Single point of failure** | If your authoritative DNS is down, your domain is unreachable |
| **DDoS attacks** | DNS infrastructure is a common DDoS target (e.g., 2016 Dyn attack took down Twitter, Netflix, Reddit) |
| **Complex management** | Large organizations have thousands of DNS records to manage |
| **DNS propagation delay** | Changes can take minutes to hours to propagate fully due to caching at multiple levels |
| **DNS hijacking** | Attackers can intercept DNS queries and return malicious IP addresses |

### Mitigations

- **Redundancy:** Use multiple DNS providers (e.g., Route 53 + CloudFlare)
- **DNSSEC:** Cryptographic signing of DNS records to prevent tampering
- **DNS over HTTPS (DoH):** Encrypt DNS queries to prevent snooping
- **Low TTLs before migrations:** Reduce TTL to 60s before making DNS changes
- **Anycast:** Distribute DNS servers globally to resist DDoS

## 10. Key Takeaways

1. **DNS translates domain names to IP addresses.** It's a globally distributed, hierarchical system.

2. **DNS resolution involves multiple steps:** Browser cache → OS cache → Resolver → Root → TLD → Authoritative. Caching makes most lookups fast.

3. **Know your record types:** A (IPv4), AAAA (IPv6), CNAME (alias), NS (nameserver), MX (mail).

4. **TTL controls caching.** Short TTL = faster failover but more queries. Long TTL = better performance but slower changes.

5. **Modern DNS does traffic routing:** Weighted, latency-based, and geolocation routing are critical tools in system design.

6. **DNS is a potential single point of failure.** Use multiple DNS providers and DNSSEC for resilience.

7. **In system design interviews,** DNS is often the first thing you draw — traffic enters your system through DNS routing to CDNs, load balancers, or regional endpoints.
